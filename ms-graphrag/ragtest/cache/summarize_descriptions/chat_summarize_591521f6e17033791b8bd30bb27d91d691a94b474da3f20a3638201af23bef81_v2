It specializes in creating, generating, and validating JWT tokens, ensuring their validity and integrity through a series of methods. JwtUtil operates by using a secret key to manage token generation and validation processes. Additionally, it is capable of verifying and decoding JWTs, a feature that underscores its role in maintaining the security and integrity of the tokens it processes. This utility class is also referenced in the context of creating mock tokens within MockJWTRepository, indicating its application in testing environments where the creation and validation of JWT tokens are simulated. Overall, JwtUtil serves as a comprehensive tool for developers needing to manage JWTs efficiently and securely.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1733811218, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 359, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
