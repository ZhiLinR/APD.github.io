It is involved in user authentication and token management processes, simulating a data store for JWTs without interacting with the actual data source. This repository class provides methods to create, retrieve, update, and fetch JWToken entries, making it an essential tool for unit testing, especially for testing token retrieval methods by UUID. It is mocked to simulate the behavior of a repository, facilitating the storage and retrieval of JWT tokens within MiddlewareService operations.
