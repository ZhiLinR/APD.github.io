It plays a crucial role in validating UUIDs, user roles, and JWT tokens, ensuring that they meet specific criteria. When these criteria are not met, ValidationUtil is responsible for throwing exceptions to signal the discrepancy. This class is integral to MiddlewareService's operations, particularly in validating JWT tokens as part of its functionality. Additionally, ValidationUtil extends its capabilities to validate JWT session data, further ensuring that there is consistency with the data stored in the database. Through its comprehensive validation processes, ValidationUtil aids in maintaining the reliability and security of applications by enforcing strict data validation rules.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1733811218, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 139, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
