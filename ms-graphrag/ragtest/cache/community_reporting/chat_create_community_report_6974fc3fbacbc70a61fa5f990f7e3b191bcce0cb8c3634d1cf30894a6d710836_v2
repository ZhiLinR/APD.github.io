It plays a crucial role in validating UUIDs, user roles, and JWT tokens, ensuring that they meet specific criteria. When these criteria are not met, ValidationUtil is responsible for throwing exceptions to signal the discrepancy. This class is integral to MiddlewareService's operations, particularly in validating JWT tokens as part of its functionality. Additionally, ValidationUtil extends its capabilities to validate JWT session data, further ensuring that there is consistency with the data stored in the database. Through its comprehensive validation processes, ValidationUtil aids in maintaining the reliability and security of applications by enforcing strict data validation rules.\",8\r\n5,UNAUTHORIZED EXCEPTION,\"UnauthorizedException is an error event that occurs in the context of MiddlewareService operations when there is an unauthorized access attempt. This exception is specifically thrown when JWT (JSON Web Token) validation fails, which can be due to various reasons such as invalidity, mismatch, or expired sessions. It represents a mechanism to signal unauthorized access attempts, ensuring that operations within the MiddlewareService are protected against unauthorized users by validating their session tokens.\",3\r\n8,JWTUTIL,\"JwtUtil is a utility class designed for handling JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It specializes in creating, generating, and validating JWT tokens, ensuring their validity and integrity through a series of methods.

Additionally, it is capable of verifying and decoding JWTs, a feature that underscores its role in maintaining the security and integrity of the tokens it processes. This utility class is also referenced in the context of creating mock tokens within MockJWTRepository, indicating its application in testing environments where the creation and validation of JWT tokens are simulated.
