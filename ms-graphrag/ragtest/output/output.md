### Recommendation: Utilize ConcurrentHashMap for Efficient Lock Management

One significant area for performance improvement in the codebase revolves around the management of locks, particularly in the context of handling JWT tokens in a multi-threaded environment. The 
current implementation leverages `LockFactory` to create and manage locks, which is a critical component for ensuring thread safety during JWT token operations. However, the efficiency of lock management can be further enhanced by leveraging the capabilities of `ConcurrentHashMap`.

#### Current Implementation

The `LockFactory` class uses `ConcurrentHashMap` to store and manage lock instances, which is a step in the right direction for thread-safe operations. This approach allows for the thread-safe retrieval and creation of locks identified by a unique name [Data: Entities (3); Sources (4)]. However, the current implementation can be optimized by reducing lock contention and improving the granularity of lock management.

#### Proposed Improvement

To improve performance, particularly in high-concurrency scenarios, the recommendation is to implement a more granular lock management strategy. Instead of using a global lock or locks at a broader scope, the system can benefit from using finer-grained locks for each JWT token or user session. This strategy reduces lock contention, allowing more threads to execute concurrently without 
waiting for a single global lock.

##### Example Code

Here's an example of how to implement this recommendation:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class EnhancedLockFactory {
    private static final ConcurrentHashMap<String, Lock> lockMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public static Lock getLock(String token) {
        // Use computeIfAbsent to atomically compute and insert a lock for a given token
        return lockMap.computeIfAbsent(token, k -> new ReentrantLock());
    }

    public static void releaseLock(String token) {
        // Optional: Consider lock removal strategy to prevent memory leak
        // This must be done carefully to avoid removing a lock that might still be in use.
    }
}
```

This enhanced approach uses `ConcurrentHashMap`'s `computeIfAbsent` method to manage locks more efficiently. Each token (or another suitable key) gets its own dedicated lock, significantly reducing the chances of lock contention. This method ensures that a lock is created if it does not exist or retrieved if it already does, all in an atomic operation, which is crucial for maintaining 
thread safety.

#### Benefits

- **Reduced Lock Contention**: By assigning a unique lock to each token or session, multiple threads can operate in parallel on different tokens, leading to better utilization of system resources.
- **Scalability**: This approach scales well with the number of concurrent users or tokens, as the locking mechanism does not become a bottleneck.
- **Flexibility**: It provides a more flexible locking strategy that can be adapted or extended based on specific requirements, such as adding timeout mechanisms or lock removal strategies to prevent memory leaks.

Implementing this recommendation can significantly enhance the performance and scalability of the system, especially in environments with high concurrency demands.
